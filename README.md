# AvalancheDemo

A simulator tool for the slush, snowflake and snowball algorithms from the [Snowflake to Avalanche](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUy4jh5mGNZvLkjies1RWM4YuvJh5o2FYopNPVYwrRVGV) paper. This implementation is only meant for demonstration purposes.

## Running

The easiest way to run is to install the angular-cli tool through npm, run `ng serve` from the root folder, and then navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.

## Using

The left menu can be used to configure different parameters of the algorithms as well as the display. The only "hidden" feature is the ability to click on nodes to display some information about their states (except byzantine nodes).

## Credits

The code was originally based on https://github.com/losfair/avalanche-demo but was then heavily refactored and integrated with Angular.
